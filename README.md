# Voting-bot

This Bot was designed for Pain Emotes server to allow better workflow for emotes submissions.
You can PR to code, every submission will be reviewed and decided to either implement, request changes or denied with reason.

Bot is open source but requires selfhosting since ID's will focus on specific server
