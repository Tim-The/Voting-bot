# Voting-bot

This Bot was designed for Pain Emotes server to allow better workflow for emotes submissions.
You can PR to code, every submission will be reviewed and decided to either implement, request changes or denied with reason.

Bot is open source but requires selfhosting since ID's will focus on specific server



## Contribution Rules  
1.work on fork of bot (duh)  
2.make comments so it can be easily analysed  
3.do meaningfull commit comments  
4.if you create code that is not relevant to existing cogs create new one  
5.do not even touch basic.py, it's forbidden territory of code that always work  
6.be carefull to not push your bot token by accident
